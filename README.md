# Homework-5: Work Day Scheduler

Date is dynamically set in the Jumbotron.

When a user select a time block they have the ability to enter an event/appointment for that hour. 
Once they click the save button, their event will be stored in local storage and will remain present in the
timeblock the next time the user returns to their scheduler.

Display qualities of the text areas are dynamically changed based on the current hour of the day.
Present time blocks will be identified in  red.
Past time blocks will be identified in grey.
Future time blocks will be identified in green.

The following images display the web applications' functionality:
